## A New Series

This series of posts aims to showcase how digital accessibility problems impact real people. While good code examples are plentiful, let's be honest—websites that implement accessibility correctly are rare. The goal isn't to shame (though if that sparks engagement, so be it), but to educate and illustrate how common these issues are in practice. I want to help people understand what to avoid, enabling them to research WCAG success criteria and grasp their implications. Ideally, this will provide ammunition to convince your boss that a particular widget needs fixing. I've been in your shoes—it's frustrating being a lone voice trying to gain traction in an organization indifferent to accessibility. I'll cover a wide range of issues so that every reader can relate to at least one of the user groups discussed. After all, one of my core beliefs is that accessibility concerns all of us as aging humans, not just people with disabilities.

## Get In Touch

Have you stumbled upon a public website with a juicy accessibility issue I haven't covered yet? Or perhaps you've discovered an exemplary case for a success criterion we've already discussed but so compelling it deserves a follow-up post? I'd love to hear about it! Send your sluthing using my first name at jeanducrot.com. Please include the URL of the site in question and location of the issue on the destination page, the success criterion (or criteria) you believe is most relevant, and why you think it's worth exploring. Don't worry, I won’t blow your cover when I publish the post in case somone gets grumpy and sends lawyers my way. Feel free to use a pen name if you'd like fellow readers to recognize your contributions. If I use the information you send, you'll receive a heartfelt thank-you in your inbox.
