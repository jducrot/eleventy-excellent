Friendly heads up: this is a long-form piece. Why? Because our experiences shape our worldview, and this is my blog so you can’t stop me. This also gives you a peek into my mind and my past, which might help you understand the perspective in some of my posts better. You're welcome.

## In The Beginning

I was born in the United States to French parents. My dad started his own art book editing company in NYC in the '70s, and by all accounts, life was good. We moved to Paris when I was a few years old, and I eventually grew up near Bordeaux in southwest France. By then, our financial situation had changed dramatically because the French business environment was very different from the American one, especially in the '80s. My parents both came from large families, so I grew up with many cousins around, for better or worse...

I attended a [Catholic private school](https://grandlebrun.com/) which, thankfully, had become co-ed by the time I arrived. We had Bible study once a week and attended mass for every major Catholic holiday. I was even a choir boy for a while. That didn't last long though, as I got kicked out of Bible study and music classes too often to be considered choir boy material... 

After graduating high school, I attended [Bordeaux University](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/en) to study economics for a year but flunked out spectacularly, mostly because I only went there to please my dad and to hang out with this one girl I liked. That summer, I jumped at the opportunity to visit friends in NYC and just never came back to France. I was 19, and my English was about as good as you'd expect from someone taught by French teachers who'd learned their trade in the UK.

## NYC

I bounced from couch to couch until I started working at Starbucks and could afford to share an apartment with a roommate in the big city. After a couple of years, I was thrilled to be named manager of a store making $2 million a year overlooking Bryant Park. The money was good for a 20-year-old, and my English was improving rapidly. It felt amazing to get to know such an incredible city and experience a real sense of independence. 

But you know what they say about what happens That all came crashing down that fall when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I quit my job at Starbucks, called her often, and became a bartender for a few months. Then I gave it all up and went home to spend the holidays with her. I returned to NYC in mid-January, and she passed away about three weeks later, just a few days before her 51st birthday and my 21st birthday.

## The U.S. Military

During my last few months with my mom, I promised her I'd graduate college. So when I returned to the States, I enlisted in the United States Air Force for the education benefits. I scored well on the tests and secured a job as a computer programmer. By April 2000, I was in basic training at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas. I then moved to Keesler AFB in Biloxi, Mississippi for "tech school," where I learned to program in the sweltering summer heat. If you enjoy standing out like a sore thumb and relish agonizingly hot, humid summers, I highly recommend joining the U.S. military and spending time in the Deep South with a strong French accent. I suppose that's why God created Louisiana…

My time in the Air Force was both amazing and highly disappointing. I initially thought I'd stay in for at least 20 years. It started well—I was assigned to the Pentagon in the summer of 2000. At the dawn of the internet age, I was learning web development and exposed to WCAG 1.0. I was there on September 11, 2001, and won several awards for my work during my 4 years there. Through a series of incredible coincidences, I ended up escorting a group of Air Force officers to France for the D-Day events in 2004. Representing the U.S. Military as a Frenchman in that setting will always remain one of the best memories of my career. When I was asked in early 2004 if I wanted to re-enlist—with a $5k bonus included—it was a no-brainer. And from there, it all went downhill.

As the ink was drying on my re-enlistment paperwork, I was told that "a mistake was made" and that I wasn't eligible for that bonus after all. I had chosen to re-enlist for only 1 year and 7 months—just long enough to cover my next assignment in California. The bonus, it turned out, was only for people who re-enlisted for a minimum of two years. Of course, I wasn't made aware of any consequences of that decision until I had signed the paperwork, leaving me no recourse but to do my time and shut up. 

So off I went to Vandenberg AFB in the fall of 2004. After three months of move prep and a two-week cross-country drive with my pregnant, uncomfortable spouse, I was nonchalantly informed that another "mistake was made"—my position in this unit didn't exist. You read that right. In the six months leading up to my arrival, nobody had picked up on that tiny detail. To top it off, this was 2004, and the United States had just invaded Iraq. In times of war, the military places limitations on internal troop movements, which meant I had no choice but to stay there and "volunteer" for every crappy detail on base—from watching people take urine tests at the base clinic to sitting at my desk and surfing the web for hours on end.

It all came to a head after I returned from spending the summer of 2006 in Iraq. I had set my mind on making lemonade out of lemons and presenting myself for officer school by the end of 2006. To that end, I had volunteered to augment the Air Force military police in Iraq for four months, figuring that willingly trading my desk job for a combat zone would surely show my dedication and earn me a 5 out of 5 on my yearly evaluation. Well, you guessed it, dear reader—I was wrong. No mistakes were made this time, though. It was all deliberate.

My boss, who was about to retire after 22 years in the Air Force, sat down with me to review my performance for the year. He told me that he wouldn't be able to give me that 5 on my annual review because a 5 is reserved for people who go "above and beyond in the exercise of their duties." To him, that meant your specific job, which of course I didn't technically have. So my final decision in the Air Force was the easiest one to make, and I left with after giving 7 years and most of my 20s to my country.

## Back In The East And Into A11y

During my time in the Air Force, I acquired several physical and cognitive disabilities. I partially tore both of my Achilles tendons, which made running very difficult and stretching a daily necessity. Upon returning from Iraq, I noticed some memory issues, which were further compounded by problems in my marriage and my one-year-old daughter experiencing a frightening episode of epileptic seizures—thankfully, she has never suffered from them since. 

We moved to Blacksburg, Virginia, for three years where I worked as a contractor for the U.S. Army. My second daughter was born in Virginia, but the South's unique societal dynamics made me feel unwelcome at the time, so we relocated to New York state in 2010. After a brief stint as a contractor for New York state, I finally landed what felt like my dream job at the time: remote software engineer for a startup. During my ten years at Interfolio, I evolved from a full-stack engineer to focusing on front-end development and eventually specializing in accessibility. Since working with WCAG 1.0 at the Pentagon in the early 2000s, I had sought opportunities to learn more about accessibility. Meeting Hadi Rangin from the University of Washington provided just that opportunity.

From there, I moved into a11y full-time as an accessibility engineer at TPGi in February 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic began. There I spent a fantastic 1.5 years learning accessibility on significant accounts like Amazon with so many accomplished pros in accessibility, many of whom I am lucky to count as friends and mentor to this day: [David Sloan](https://www.tpgi.com/author/dsloan/), [Sarah Horton](https://sarahhortondesign.com/), [Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/), [Ian Lloyd](https://lloydi.com/), [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/), [Ashley Bischoff](https://www.tpgi.com/author/ashleyb/), [Steve Faulkner](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/02/09/meet-the-team-steve-faulkner/).

After a year and a half, I missed working within a single company and moved to the accessibility team at Pearson. Unfortunately, Pearson as a company doesn't take accessibility as seriously as it should, despite having a small but mighty a11y team filled with mighty good people. Since January 2024, I am with the accessibility team at Elsevier, where I've been put in charge of improving employee tooling accessibility—and I'm enjoying every minute of it.

## Personal Life

I will forever be grateful and proud to be the father of two wonderful daughters. Although things didn't work out with their mother, I can't help but beam as I see them grow into the women they are becoming. Our relationships haven't always been easy, but I've always tried my best and only ever asked them to do the same.

I'm also a very lucky man for having found love more than once. I married my soulmate, Marcella, in the summer of 2023. She's the one who took the time to get to know me when I had forgotten who I was, who listened when I seemingly had nothing to say, who always believes in me (and the Mets, Jets, and Knicks) when hope is in short supply. She's the only person I've ever met who loves sports for the sake of competition and human achievement as much as I do. She's the one who lets me be myself when no one else knows what to do with that.

## FAQ

- **Do you miss your family?** Sure. Some of them, sometimes. Anyone who comes from a large family will understand what I mean by that...
- **Do you miss living in France?** Sometimes, but no place is perfect. I love many things about the United States and somes things drive me crazy every time I go back to France. I am proud of my French lineage but I have an independant streak
